We Built the app in a 90s theme, thus the horrible coloring comparing to our 2020s standards.
The code is divided into three main components according to the 3-tier module:
* UI
* Controller
* BL

## Structure
### UI
This module's goal is to manage all the UI related functions. Anything that the user sees and interacts with
is located here.

### BL
The game's logic is described here. All the logical operations AKA the game's rules are done in this component.

### Controller
In order for the UI and BL to interact we built a separated module in charge of integrating the two components.

### Main
The main is in charge of building the UI, BL and Controller components and nothing else.
